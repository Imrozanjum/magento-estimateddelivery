Meanbee Estimated Delivery Extension
=====================
Estimated delivery information has been present on some of the largest and most successful eCommerce stores on the web, but until now, has been absent from Magento. Meanbee's Estimated Delivery extension is a fantastic way to bring this functionality to your store at the fraction of the price it would cost to hire a developer. Meanbee's Estimated Delivery adds some additional text beneath your shipping method options on the checkout, as well as an additional section on your order success page so your customers know exactly when to expect your package.

##### Features
- Add highly customisable component to the admin area which allows you to configure exactly how long your delivery process takes.
- Add text to your store's checkout and order success page.
- Optional date picker for customers to select delivery date.
- Works great with Meanbee's Shipping Rules

##### Compatibility
 Compatibility: 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9
